This is my first responsive web project after completing freeCodeCampâ€™s Responsive Web Design Certification. The goal was to practice building a real-world UI by recreating the Facebook landing page using only HTML5 and CSS3.
I wanted to strengthen the concepts that I previously struggled to grasp whilst also strengthening the concepts I fully comprehend - all in a basic landing page project. 

With this being my first webpage mini-project, There are some noticable flaws in spacing, positioning, and sizing. Once again, this is my first project, and I will continue to sharpen my front-end skills, and create responsive and authentic UI's.
